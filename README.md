### *If the readme is a readme but what made the readme doesn't exist anymore is it still a readme?*
## DirectX MC
Soft wrapped text.. Yes. And have you ever wondered what Minecraft would look if it had DirectX? Me neither.. GLSL was enough. But hey, have to overcomplicate everything that exists, am I right?


Well.. For ***1.12.2***. 
# Gradle setup (how to build??????)
You just type in ```gradlew build``` or ```./gradlew build```.. Although I assume no linux user will even see this.

```gradlew tasks```or```./gradlew tasks``` to view all the gradle tasks. Final binary on GitHub or Modrinth for lazy people.
